<strong>Description</strong>
Aimed at KS3 learners, this Academy is for those wishing to gain more practical experience and to learn about the foundations of the zoo industry. It will compromise of both practical workshops and classroom-based learning covering a range of animal science-based topics. Practical experience can vary across multiple species across the zoo, but will include: working as a team to complete challenges such as mucking out, diet preparation, making enrichment and a scientific behavioural observation!
