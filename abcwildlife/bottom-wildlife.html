<strong>Description</strong>
Aimed at KS2 learners, this Academy is our youngest age bracket for mini zoo keepers. Packed full of interactive learning and working behind the scenes, it will be a day they will never forget. Get up close and personal with our minibeasts, get stuck in and muck out some of our smaller animal friends and work as a team to make some animal enrichment!
